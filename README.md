I am a Full-Stack Developer at SAP Labs with 4+ years of experience building and supporting scalable enterprise applications.

At SAP, I design and develop Java and Spring Boot–based backend services, SAPUI5 user interfaces, and REST APIs, contributing to new features and microservice enhancements. I follow strong engineering practices by writing comprehensive unit tests, performing code reviews, and ensuring code quality through SonarQube, API automation testing, and secure dependency management.

Previously, I contributed to large-scale applications at Jio Platforms, including the Employee Self Service (ESS) mobile application used by 200,000+ employees, and customer-facing portals for petrochemical products.

I enjoy working in agile teams, collaborating closely with product and business stakeholders, and solving complex backend, performance, and reliability challenges. I am particularly interested in backend development, microservices, and system optimization.
