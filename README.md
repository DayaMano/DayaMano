## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Full-Stack Developer at **SAP Labs**, working primarily on **Java & Spring Boot–based backend systems** and **SAPUI5 frontend applications**. I build and maintain **RESTful microservices**, contribute to new product features, and focus heavily on **code quality, performance, and reliability**.

I strongly believe in solid engineering practices — writing clean, testable code, performing thorough code reviews, and maintaining high standards using tools like **SonarQube**, **API automation testing**, and **secure dependency management**.

Before SAP, I worked at **Jio Platforms**, contributing to large-scale systems including:
- 📱 **Employee Self Service (ESS) mobile app** used by **200,000+ employees**
- 🌐 Customer-facing portals for **petrochemical products**

I enjoy working in **agile teams**, collaborating closely with product and business stakeholders, and tackling **complex backend, performance, and system-design challenges**.

💡 **Current interests:** Backend development · Microservices · System optimization · Scalable architectures
